Online Bus Ticket Booking Application Documentation
1. Introduction
This project aims to create an online bus ticket booking system that allows users to browse bus routes, book tickets, manage their profiles, and view booking history. The application uses Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. The system is built with a simple architecture that integrates various technologies for ease of use and scalability.

2. System Architecture
The application follows a simple three-tier architecture:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React)
Backend: Spring Boot
Database: MySQL
Technology Stack:

Frontend:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
React.js for UI Components
Axios for HTTP requests
Backend:
Spring Boot (RESTful API)
Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication
Spring Data JPA for database integration
Database: MySQL
API Flow:

Frontend makes HTTP requests using Axios.
Spring Boot processes the requests and communicates with the MySQL database.
Responses from the backend are sent to the frontend, where the user interface is dynamically updated.
3. Setup Instructions
3.1 Setting Up the Backend (Spring Boot)
Create a Spring Boot Project:

Use Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) to generate a new project with dependencies:
Spring Web
Spring Data JPA
Spring Security
MySQL Driver
Define the Data Model:

Define the following entities:
Bus: Represents the bus details.
Booking: Represents a booking made by the user.
Passenger: Represents passenger information (name, email, etc.).
User: Represents user information (name, email, password).
Implement RESTful APIs:

Create controllers for handling bus routes, bookings, and user authentication.
Use Spring Security to manage user authentication via JWT.
Implement CRUD operations for bus schedules and booking management.
Example of RESTful controller for user authentication:
java
Copy code
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/auth")
public class AuthController {

    @Autowired
    private AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;
    @Autowired
    private JwtTokenProvider tokenProvider;
    @Autowired
    private UserDetailsService userDetailsService;

    @PostMapping("/login")
    public ResponseEntity<?> login(@RequestBody LoginRequest loginRequest) {
        Authentication authentication = authenticationManager.authenticate(
                new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(
                        loginRequest.getUsername(),
                        loginRequest.getPassword()
                )
        );
        SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication);
        String jwt = tokenProvider.generateToken(authentication);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(new JwtAuthenticationResponse(jwt));
    }
}
Set Up the MySQL Database:

Create a MySQL database and update application.properties in Spring Boot to connect to the database:
properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bus_booking_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
3.2 Setting Up the Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)
Frontend Setup:

Create a new React project using:
bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app bus-ticket-booking
Install Axios for HTTP requests:
bash
Copy code
npm install axios
Designing UI:

Use HTML5 and CSS3 for the structure and styling.
Create components for:
User Registration
User Login
Bus Route Selection
Booking Form
User Profile
Handling API Requests:

Use Axios to connect with Spring Boot APIs.
Example: Fetch bus routes:
javascript
Copy code
import axios from 'axios';

const fetchBusRoutes = () => {
    axios.get('http://localhost:8080/api/bus-routes')
        .then(response => {
            console.log(response.data);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error('There was an error!', error);
        });
};
Responsive UI:

Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap to make the UI responsive and visually appealing.
4. User Registration and Authentication
User Registration:

Develop an HTML form to collect user information (name, email, password).
Use React for form handling.
Server-side validation (ensure data integrity).
User Authentication:

Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
Upon successful login, generate a JWT token and store it in local storage for future requests.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
localStorage.setItem('jwtToken', response.data.jwt);
JWT Token Validation:

On the backend, use Spring Security with JWT filters to validate tokens.
The backend will send a 401 Unauthorized response if the JWT is invalid or expired.
5. Bus Ticket Booking
Browse and Select Bus Routes:

Create a form to allow users to select their departure and arrival destinations.
Display available bus routes, with times, pricing, and availability.
Use React components to dynamically render the routes.
Booking Process:

Develop booking forms to collect user details (passenger name, seat preferences).
On form submission, send a POST request to the backend to book the ticket.
Send confirmation with e-ticket upon successful booking.
Example POST request:
javascript
Copy code
axios.post('http://localhost:8080/api/bookings', bookingData)
.then(response => {
    console.log('Booking confirmed', response);
})
.catch(error => {
    console.error('Error in booking', error);
});
6. User Profile and Booking History
User Profile:

Allow users to view and update their profile information (name, email).
Implement functionalities for changing the password and managing payment methods.
Booking History:

Display a list of past bookings made by the user.
Retrieve booking data from the backend and display it in the frontend.
7. Testing and Quality Assurance
Unit Testing:

Use JUnit for backend unit tests and Jest for frontend unit tests.
Create tests for services, controllers, and React components.
Integration Testing:

Test the communication between frontend and backend using tools like Postman.
Write tests to ensure the full stack works together (from frontend API calls to backend responses).
UI/UX Testing:

Perform usability tests to ensure the user experience is intuitive.
Validate responsiveness across various devices.
Performance Testing:

Use tools like JMeter to simulate multiple users and measure system performance under load.
8. Conclusion
The Online Bus Ticket Booking Application provides users with a seamless experience for booking bus tickets online. The application incorporates secure user authentication, dynamic bus route listings, easy booking functionality, and a user-friendly profile management system. Through this application, users can efficiently search for bus routes, book tickets, and manage their booking history.
